          Transportation: Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though
          some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for
          one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can
          accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process
          of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the
          island within the next few years.

          Ground Transportation: Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5
          a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island.
          Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from
          a local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are
          available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law).
          Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in
          the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on
          foot.
